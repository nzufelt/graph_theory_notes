\section{Trees}\label{sec:trees}

This is the section on Trees, still to be completed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition: A tree is a connected graph with no circuits/cycles.
    \item TFAE:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $T$ is a tree,
        \item $T$ contains no circuits/cycles and has $v-1$ edges,
        \item $T$ is connected and has $v-1$ edges,
        \item $T$ is connected and every edge of $T$ is a \textbf{bridge}, \textit{i.e.} it lies in a disconnecting set of a size one,
        \item Any two vertices of $T$ have a unique path conntecting them,
        \item $T$ contains no circuits/cycles but the addition of any new edge produces exactly one circuit/cycle.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Def spanning trees





\end{itemize}
