\section{Trees}\label{sec:trees}

This is the section on Trees, still to be completed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition: A tree is a connected graph with no circuits/cycles.
    \item TFAE:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $T$ is a tree,
        \item $T$ contains no circuits/cycles and has $v-1$ edges,
        \item $T$ is connected and has $v-1$ edges,
        \item $T$ is connected and every edge of $T$ is a \textbf{bridge}, \textit{i.e.} it lies in a disconnecting set of a size one,
        \item Any two vertices of $T$ have a unique path conntecting them,
        \item $T$ contains no circuits/cycles but the addition of any new edge produces exactly one circuit/cycle.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Def spanning trees
    \item prove that if a tree has a vertex of degree $p$, then it has at least $p$ \textit{leaves}, \textit{i.e.} vertices of degree $1$.
    \item Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $2 \leq k \leq n-1$.  Construct a family of trees $T_{n,k}$ with $n$ vertices and $k$ leaves.  Can a tree have any other combination of $n$ and $k$?
    \item Let $T$ be a tree with $v$ vertices.  Prove that the length of the shortest cycle (or closed path) that includes each edge of $G$ at least once is $2(n-1)$.





\end{itemize}
