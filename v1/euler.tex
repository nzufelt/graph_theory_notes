\section{Eulerian and Hamiltonian Path}\label{sec:euler}

% Rephrase using cycles and add cycles to the appropriate place

\begin{itemize}
    \item A path is \textbf{closed} if $v_1 = v_n$, otherwise it is \textbf{open}.
    \item A path is \textbf{simple} if $|\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}| = n$ if open or $n-1$ if closed. % cycles instead?
    \item simple is equivalent to having no interior overlap
    \item examples
    \item An Eulerian path uses every edge in the graph exactly once
    \item examples
    \item they're simple
    \item A connected graph has a closed Eulerian path if and only if every vertex is even.
    \item There is an Eulerian cycle beginning at any vertex in a graph with all even vertices
    \item A connected graph has an open Eulerian path if and only if every vertex is even except for exactly two.
    \item the path must begin at one of the two odd vertices
    \item A Hamiltonian path is one which uses every vertex exactly once (if closed, the first and last vertex is repeated)
    \item examples
    \item lemma If the sum of the degrees of every pair of vertices of a graph is at least $v-1$, then
    \begin{itemize}
        \item every pair of vertices are either adjacent to each other or to a common third vertex, and
        \item $G$ is connected
    \end{itemize}
    \item if the sum of the degrees of every pair of vertices of $G$ is at least $v-1$, then $G$ has an open Hamiltonian path
    \item if the sum of the degrees of every pair of vertices of $G$ is at least $v$, then $G$ has an closed Hamiltonian path
    \item a \textbf{skein} is an object consisting of two vertices connected by two or more lines (finite?)
    \item a \textbf{multigraph} $M(G)$ is an object consisting of a graph $G$ where some of its edges are replaced by skeins.  $G$ is called a \textbf{generator} of $M$
    \item generators are unique
    \item examples
    \item define some terms for multigraphs and prove them?
    \item a walk in a multigraph is, a euler walk is, a hamilton walk is$\ldots$
    \item A connected multigraph has a closed euler walk iff every vertex is even.
    \item same thing again with the open walk and two odd edges
    \item K\"{o}nigsberg Bridge Problem
    \item The sum of the degrees of the vertices of a multigraph is 2e
    \item Every multigraph has an even number of odd vertices
    \item applications?  aren't there tons?
    \item exercises
\end{itemize}
